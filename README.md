Network Intrusion Detection Systems
Jan 2024 - Apr 2024
• Engineered a Jupyter Notebook and made a prediction for the network intrusion in two ways: attack made or not & which type of attack. Dataset Used - UNSW NB-15.

• Performed Data Mining and preprocessing, Feature Extraction & Feature Selection using Cuckoo Search Algorithm.

• Used SMOTE Techniques to overcome class imbalance problem.

• 25+ machine learning algorithms used for fitting the model.

• Used libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow.

• Evaluated on multiple metrics like jaccard score , accuracy , precision , recall , F-score , balanced_accuracy_score , R2 score , zero one loss , hamming loss, cohen kappa score , matthews corelation coefficient score etc.
